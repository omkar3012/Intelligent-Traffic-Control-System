## 🔄 Technical Workflow

### **1. Image Processing Pipeline**
```python
User Upload → Frontend Validation → Backend API → Google Vision API → Vehicle Detection → Signal Calculation → Response
```

### **2. Vehicle Detection Process**
- **Input**: Traffic intersection images (JPEG/PNG)
- **Processing**: Google Vision API object localization
- **Filter**: Extract vehicle objects (cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles)
- **Output**: Vehicle count, types, confidence scores, bounding boxes

### **3. Intelligent Signal Timing Algorithm**
```python
def calculate_signal_timing(vehicle_count: int):
    base_green = 15  # Minimum green time
    max_green = 60   # Maximum green time
    
    if vehicle_count <= 5:
        green_time = base_green + (vehicle_count * 2)
    elif vehicle_count <= 15:
        green_time = base_green + 10 + ((vehicle_count - 5) * 1.5)
    else:
        green_time = max_green
    
    return adaptive_timing_object
```
